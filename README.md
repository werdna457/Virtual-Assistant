# Virtual-Assistant
You'll need "VA.py" and "Aps.txt" downloaded to the same folder for this to work. You'll also need to install "SpeechRecognition" "gtts" and "playsound" through pip, and pyaudio from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio. This is made for Python 3.9

Commands so far are "Hello", "Who are you?", "What's the time?", "Make an appointment", and "Goodbye", which ends the program

Thanks https://dev.to/vinayveerappaji/create-your-own-simple-virtual-assistant-1kfp for the jumping off point

## Installation
To dependancies run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
To install PyAudio, run `pip install [filepath]` where filepath is the filepath of the corresponding pyaudio wheel.
